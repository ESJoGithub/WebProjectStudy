      <p>Beginning August 1st, animals will be available for viewing by appointment at each of the seven animal care centers. You will be able to self-schedule an appointment on our website and select from available slots. During your appointment visit, a staff member of volunteer will assist you and you will be able to view all animals that are “Ready to Go Home” that day. This means they are spayed or neutered, off stray hold and have gone to dog playgroups at least once (for dogs over 35 lbs.).  Animals will be available first-come, first-served.  We are confident this enhanced experience will allow potential adopters to view and adopt animals in a way that is accessible and maintains animal health and wellbeing. Click here to self-schedule an appointment. Our call center is available 24/7 if you do not have access to the internet. Walk up appointments will be accommodated as available.</p>
