      <h1>Full Screen Responsive Image Gallery</h1>
      <p>Looking back over the course of Gallery Hyundai’s fifty-year history, 
        we have come to mark the occasion with a sense of gratitude 
        and compulsion to pay our respects to the Korean contemporary art world.
        Our boundless gratitude goes to everyone over the years 
        who helped our gallery achieve this milestone including, among others, 
        the artists, art lovers, critics, curators, educators, historians, 
        cultural officials, journalists, patrons, dealers, suppliers, 
        connoisseurs and philanthropists. 
        It is only with the passion, dedication and support of these diverse individuals 
        that Gallery Hyundai has been able to overcome numerous challenges 
        and to reach this day. That being said, the ones who must be thanked 
        and celebrated the most remain the artists themselves. 
        For your passion and sweat-soaked work 
        and focus we give you our truest thanks.
